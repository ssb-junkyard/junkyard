# junkyard
what is ssb-junkyard? This is a space for holding all the modules we wrote once that no one uses any more.
Maybe they'll be useful or important to look at in some future time, but lets move things like that here to avoid cluttering the main ssbc org, and so we don't have to document it. If it's in the junkyard, you can probably ignore it.
